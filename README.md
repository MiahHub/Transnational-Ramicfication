## Description

This project is a collection of APIs for a social medial application.

## User Story

AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user’s friend list

## Motivation

Project motivation came from the desire to complete a NOSQL API project based on what I have learned in bootcamp so far and to satisfy course requirements for Module 18.

## Learn

I learned how to apply routes to handle requests and actions within Insomnia to interact with MongoDB.

## Usage

This API collection may be used by anyone who wants to create of modify APIs.

## Installation

Installation requires the following dependencies:
Express, mongoose, moment, nodemon.
